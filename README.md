Sudoku is a puzzle that involves filling a grid of 9x9 cells with numbers such that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid (also called blocks or regions) contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. Here is a general strategy you can use to solve a sudoku puzzle:

 1. Look for cells with only one possible value. This is called "singles."
 2. Look for numbers that can only be placed in one cell within a row, column, or block. This is called "hidden singles."
 3. Look for pairs, triplets, or quads of numbers that can only be placed in a certain number of cells within a row, column, or block. This is called "interactions."
 4. Look for cells that are part of multiple subgrids (also called "intersections") and see if you can use that information to narrow down the possible values for those cells.
 5. Repeat the above steps until the puzzle is solved.

It's also a good idea to check your work regularly to make sure you haven't made any mistakes. If you get stuck, you can try using additional techniques such as "naked pairs," "naked triples," and "naked quads," or you can try making an educated guess and then working from there (this is called "trial and error").
